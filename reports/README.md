# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

### Question 3
> **A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework**
> **did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used the third-party framework Arrow in our project. We used functionality of writing parquet format files after preprocessing from the pyarrow package to keep data types consistent between datasets as we found csv in some cases converting Int to Float when preprocessing.


## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We used pip and conda for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using pip freeze > requirements.txt . To get a complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands "conda create --name my_environment python=3.10" and "pip install -r requirements.txt"

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

We used the cookiecutter template provided by the course. Apart from adding additional files to the different folders (e.g. entrypoint.sh or drift_report.py) we did not change the structure.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we used ruff to automatically format our codebase and make sure that the coding style is coherent across team members. Similarly, we tried to make sure to include documentation for all functions that we implemented. Especially in projects with multiple stakeholders this type of streamlining is important to make sure that collaboration can happen smoothly and no unnecessary time is wasted on trying to decipher other people's code. 

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

We implemented
- 2 test for data preprocessing, checking the data saving process and the data cleaning prcoess with mock data
- 1 test for the training, checking that the data loading works
- 1 test for the model, checking that the pipeline works
- 1 test for the api with a sample input

So in total we implemented 5 tests, asserting that the key functions work as expected. 

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

The overall coerage is 13\%, partially also because we did not implement test for non-cores scripts such as the visualisation fo the model outcomes. However, also if the coverage would be close to 100\% one cannot be sure that everything works as expected. Unit test always only test very particular aspects of isolated parts of code. Thus, there can also occur errors that hadn't been anticipated (and thus not considered in the testing) or that occur when parts of the application are connected (which would need more integrative testing to be detected).

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, our workflow did include branches and pull requests. Initially, we all created personal branches to work on. In the end, however, we mostly worked on the main branch since we were anyways in close communication all the time. However, especially for larger coding projects were it is much harder to maintain an overview of who is working on what, branches in combination with pull requests and a list of required test that need to be passed before a merge is enabled, are definitely helpful to make sure it doesn't get all messy.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

We used DVC in our project by uploading the raw data to a public bucket. It did as such not help us in this specific project as we did not require updating the version, but in future cases it will be helpful as it allows to version the training/validation and test data used. 

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We used docker for training using a combination of docker+vertex ai. Thus an image based of main.dockerfile will run the the training and save results to WANDB.
We also used docker for the API which allows accessing the sentiment analysis via cloud run, as well as the data-drift report.

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

We mostly performed debugging by running the code and following up on error messages. We experimented with profiling during the exercises but did not use it for the project.

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

>
> Answer:

We used:
Google storage: Used to create buckets that can contain data, models, etc.
Cloud Vertex AI: Used to spin up brief VM's for specific tasks. Used for training in combination with WANDB.
Artifact Registry: Used to build and store docker images in the cloud and retrieve if needed.
Cloud Run: Used to deploy API's accessible from the web.
